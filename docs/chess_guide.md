## 🚀 1. The Core Objective: Checkmate

Before moving a single piece, you must understand the goal. Chess is a game of **Capture the King**.

- **The Mission**: Your entire strategy centers around trapping the opponent's King so that it is under attack and has no legal way to escape. This is called **Checkmate**.
- **Check**: When the King is under attack but can still escape (by moving, blocking the attack, or capturing the attacker).
- **Checkmate**: When the King is in check and **none** of the escape methods work. **The game ends immediately.**

## 🗺️ 2. How to Read & Write Moves (PGN)

To track games, we use **Algebraic Notation** or **PGN (Portable Game Notation)**.

### The Grid

- **Files (Columns)**: Labeled **a** through **h**.
- **Ranks (Rows)**: Labeled **1** through **8**.
- **Squares**: A square is named by its file and rank (e.g., **e4**).

### The Pieces Shorthand

- **K**: King | **Q**: Queen | **R**: Rook | **B**: Bishop | **N**: Knight | **(None)**: Pawn
- **Special Symbols**:
  - `x`: Capture (e.g., `Bxe5`)
  - `+`: Check (e.g., `Qh5+`)
  - `#`: Checkmate (e.g., `Qxf7#`)

### ⚔️ Piece Movement Basics

- **King**: One square in any direction.
- **Queen**: Any number of squares in any direction.
- **Rook**: Any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
- **Bishop**: Any number of squares diagonally.
- **Knight**: "L-shape" (2 squares one way, 1 square perpendicular). The only piece that can jump over others.
- **Pawn**: One square forward (or two on the first move). Captures diagonally.
